# Refunds Service Infrastructure

This repository contains the infrastructure implementation for the Refunds Service, a comprehensive module within the Brik platform designed to process, manage, and track refunds across diverse payment methods and workflows.

## Overview

The Refunds Service infrastructure is designed for high reliability, security, and scalability to support mission-critical financial transactions. It leverages AWS cloud services with infrastructure-as-code principles to ensure consistent and repeatable deployments.

## Infrastructure Components

### Deployment Environment

The Refunds Service operates in multiple environments following a structured promotion path:

- **Development**: For ongoing development and testing
- **Test**: For integration testing
- **Staging**: Production-like environment for final validation
- **Production**: Live environment with highest reliability requirements

Each environment is provisioned with appropriate resources to meet its specific purpose, with production configured for maximum reliability and performance.

### Cloud Services

#### Core AWS Services

| Service Category | AWS Service | Purpose |
|-----------------|-------------|----------|
| Compute | ECS Fargate | Container orchestration without server management |
| Networking | Application Load Balancer | HTTP/HTTPS load balancing |
| Networking | CloudFront | Content delivery and API caching |
| Networking | Route53 | DNS management and routing policies |
| Storage | S3 | Document storage, logs, and backups |
| Database | MongoDB Atlas | Primary document database |
| Caching | ElastiCache (Redis) | Parameter caching and distributed locking |
| Messaging | SQS | Asynchronous processing and job queues |
| Messaging | EventBridge | Event routing between services |
| Security | KMS | Encryption key management |
| Security | Secrets Manager | Secure credential storage |
| Security | WAF | Web application firewall |
| Monitoring | CloudWatch | Infrastructure and application monitoring |
| Monitoring | X-Ray | Distributed tracing |

#### High Availability Design

The infrastructure follows a multi-layered approach for high availability:

- **Public Layer**: Route53, CloudFront, WAF, Application Load Balancer
- **Application Layer**: ECS Fargate cluster with services distributed across multiple AZs
- **Data Layer**: MongoDB Atlas with multi-region capabilities, ElastiCache Redis in cluster mode
- **Security Layer**: Encryption at rest and in transit, IAM roles with least privilege
- **Monitoring Layer**: Comprehensive monitoring and alerting for all components

### Containerization

The Refunds Service uses Docker containers for consistent deployment across environments:

- **Container Runtime**: Docker 24.0+
- **Base Images**: Distroless Python 3.11+ for backend services
- **Image Management**: Multi-stage builds to reduce image size and attack surface
- **Registry**: Amazon ECR with image scanning enabled

Service resource allocations are configured as follows:

| Service | CPU Allocation | Memory Allocation | Instance Count |
|---------|---------------|-------------------|----------------|
| Refund API Service | 1 vCPU | 2 GB | 3-10 (auto-scaled) |
| Refund Request Manager | 2 vCPU | 4 GB | 2-8 (auto-scaled) |
| Gateway Integration Service | 1 vCPU | 2 GB | 2-6 (auto-scaled) |
| Parameter Resolution Service | 0.5 vCPU | 1 GB | 2-4 (auto-scaled) |
| Reporting Engine | 2 vCPU | 4 GB | 1-3 (auto-scaled) |

### Orchestration

#### ECS Cluster Configuration

The ECS cluster is configured with Fargate for serverless container execution:

- **Capacity Provider**: Fargate for production services
- **Task Placement**: Spread across Availability Zones for high availability
- **Networking**: Private subnets with NAT gateway for outbound traffic
- **Service Discovery**: AWS Cloud Map for service-to-service communication

#### Auto-scaling Configuration

Services scale automatically based on the following metrics:

| Service | Primary Scaling Metric | Scale Out Threshold | Scale In Threshold | Min/Max Instances |
|---------|------------------------|--------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Refund API Service | CPU Utilization | >70% | <30% | 3/10 |
| Refund Request Manager | SQS Queue Depth | >1000 messages | <100 messages | 2/8 |
| Gateway Integration | Request Rate | >50 req/min | <10 req/min | 2/6 |
| Parameter Service | CPU Utilization | >70% | <30% | 2/4 |

### CI/CD Pipeline

The Refunds Service employs a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions:

#### Build Pipeline

1. **Static Analysis**: SonarQube, Pylint, ESLint
2. **Unit Tests**: pytest with 90%+ code coverage
3. **Security Scanning**: Snyk, OWASP Dependency Check
4. **Build Artifacts**: Container images, Terraform plans

#### Deployment Pipeline

1. **Deploy to Development**: Automatic on main branch merge
2. **Integration Tests**: Validates service interactions
3. **Deploy to Test**: After successful integration tests
4. **System Tests**: End-to-end validation
5. **Deploy to Staging**: After successful system tests
6. **User Acceptance Tests**: Final validation
7. **Approval Gate**: Manual approval for production
8. **Deploy to Production**: Blue/green deployment with canary testing

#### Rollback Procedures

Rollback is triggered automatically under these conditions:

- Failed health checks
- Elevated error rate (>1%)
- Performance degradation beyond thresholds
- Security vulnerabilities

### Infrastructure Monitoring

#### Monitoring Strategy

The infrastructure employs a multi-layer monitoring approach:

- **Infrastructure**: CloudWatch monitors compute, network, and storage resources
- **Application**: DataDog APM tracks service performance and throughput
- **Business**: Custom dashboards for refund volumes, approval rates, etc.
- **Security**: GuardDuty and CloudTrail for security monitoring

#### Observability Implementation

The monitoring system includes:

- **Metrics Collection**: CloudWatch, DataDog
- **Log Aggregation**: Centralized logging with ELK stack
- **Distributed Tracing**: OpenTelemetry with X-Ray and DataDog APM
- **Alerting**: PagerDuty for critical alerts, email/Slack for non-critical

### Infrastructure Security

#### Network Security

- VPC with public/private subnets
- Security groups with least privilege access
- Web Application Firewall (WAF) for API protection
- Network ACLs for subnet-level security

#### Data Protection

- Encryption at rest using KMS for all data stores
- TLS 1.3 for all communications
- Field-level encryption for sensitive data
- PCI-DSS compliant key management

#### Authentication and Authorization

- IAM roles for service-to-service communication
- JWT with OAuth 2.0 for user authentication
- RBAC for granular authorization
- MFA for administrative access

### Disaster Recovery

#### Backup and Restoration

| Component | Backup Method | Frequency | Retention | Recovery Target |
|-----------|--------------|-----------|-----------|---------------|
| MongoDB Data | Point-in-time snapshots | Hourly | 30 days | RPO: 1 hour, RTO: 1 hour |
| Transaction Records | Continuous replication | Real-time | 7 years | RPO: <1 minute, RTO: <15 minutes |
| Configuration Data | Version-controlled + snapshots | Daily | 90 days | RPO: 24 hours, RTO: 1 hour |
| Logs & Audit Data | Archived to S3 | Real-time | 7 years | RPO: <5 minutes, RTO: 4 hours |

#### Business Continuity Testing

Regular disaster recovery tests are conducted to ensure readiness:

- Simulated AZ failures (monthly)
- Regional failover tests (quarterly)
- Data recovery drills (quarterly)
- Full DR test (annually)

## Getting Started

terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

## Documentation

For more detailed information, please refer to the following documentation:

- [Infrastructure Scripts](./scripts/README.md)
- [Monitoring Configuration](./monitoring/README.md)
- [CloudFormation Templates](./cloudformation/README.md)

## Contributing

### Development Workflow

1. Create a feature branch from `main`
2. Make infrastructure changes
3. Test changes in development environment
4. Submit a pull request for review
5. After approval, changes will be merged and deployed through the CI/CD pipeline

### Best Practices

- Follow infrastructure-as-code principles
- Ensure all resources have appropriate tags
- Document all changes thoroughly
- Include automated tests for infrastructure changes
- Follow the least privilege principle for IAM roles

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **Terraform State Lock**: If a state lock persists, it may need to be manually released
- **ECS Service Deployment Failures**: Check service logs and task definitions
- **CloudFormation Stack Creation Errors**: Review the events in CloudFormation console
- **Permission Issues**: Verify IAM roles and policies have appropriate permissions
